# Cyber Sareen
Hey there! I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast and a curious student. When I was younger, I was fascinated by the fact that everything possesses some kind of weakness or vulnerability.
<br>
Theres no human born who is picture perfect to do any work with fine perfection; every project has some of its mistakes.
I love finding mistakes. In myself, in other things, and in other businesses, and that made me learn so many things because mistakes are the only true and real factors a person can use to
<br>
build their empire because the one who never sat down and tried to find where he or she went wrong is the person who never tried and will never accomplish anything in his or her life.

<br>

I found that the cybersecurity domain is nothing but finding mistakes in programs that can be voided by others.

<br>

# So I choose to go with digital forensics to find the mistakes of hackers who forgot to clear their tracks or digital footprints (by mistake ofcource). ﻿
