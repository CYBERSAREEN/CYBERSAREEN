# Cyber Sareen
Greetings! I am a dedicated cybersecurity enthusiast and an inquisitive student, driven by a profound fascination with the inherent vulnerabilities present in various systems. Recognizing the truth that perfection is an elusive quality, both in human endeavors and technological landscapes, has been a guiding principle in my pursuits.<br>
<br>
The pursuit of excellence is intricately tied to the acknowledgment of imperfections, and I derive immense satisfaction from the meticulous process of uncovering and understanding these intricacies. This philosophy has become a cornerstone in my personal and professional development, as I believe that true growth stems from the recognition and rectification of mistakes.<br>
<br>
In my journey, I have cultivated a keen interest in the cybersecurity domain, which I perceive as an intricate chess game where adversaries leave traces of their actions. My focus has naturally gravitated towards digital forensics, a field that allows me to methodically investigate and uncover the mistakes made by cyber intruders.<br>

# So I choose to go with digital forensics to find the mistakes of hackers who forgot to clear their tracks or digital footprints (by mistake ofcource). ﻿
